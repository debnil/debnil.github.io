<p>Hi! I'm Debnil. Here's my <a href="https://twitter.com/debnilsur">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debnilsur/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/debnil/debnil.github.io/blob/master/CV%20-%20General%20-%20Debnil%20Sur.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

<p>I live in San Francisco and build systems at <a href="https://interstellar.com/">Interstellar</a>. In my free time, I coach policy debate at <a href="http://www.lowellstudentassociation.com/forensic-society-speech--debate.html">Lowell High School</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I received a BS and MS in <a href=https://cs.stanford.edu/>Computer Science</a> from <a href=https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. As an undergrad, I served on the residential student staff at <a href="https://resed.stanford.edu/residences/find-house/roble-hall">Roble Hall</a>, studied abroad in Oxford and Edinburgh, and worked with the <a href="">Silicon Valley Urban Debate League</a> to establish and run debate programs in low-income Peninsula high schools. It was also a time of deep confusion, exploration, soul-searching, and growth. I had the opportunity to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PwYo6QZxZ4">speak</a> about that experience.</p>

<p>I spent much of my master's focused on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=61sQ2zAAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2">research</a>. A stab at summarizing my absurdly broad research interests: through improvements in tools and algorithms, I use software to help non-practitioners leverage machine learning. I had the privilege of working with <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/">Alex Aiken</a>, <a href="https://www.pandelab.org/">Vijay Pande</a>, and <a href="http://yuba.stanford.edu/~nickm/">Nick McKeown</a> on projects under this umbrella.</p>
  
<p>Even before that, I graduated from <a href="http://www.bcp.org/">Bellarmine College Preparatory</a> in San Jose (Go Bells!). I doubt any high school students will come across this page, but if you do, I strongly encourage that you get involved in forensics, particularly policy debate. It has changed and shaped my life more than anything else I have done.</p>
